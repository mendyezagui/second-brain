 * Has the gap list actually moved since the stored draft?

 * This cannot be `JSON.stringify(a) !== JSON.stringify(b)`, and the reason is
 * not cosmetic. `sofa_flyers.missing` is a jsonb column, and Postgres does not
 * preserve object key order in jsonb — it re-sorts keys by length, then
 * bytewise. So a gap written as {field,label,severity,question} reads back as
 * {field,label,question,severity}, and a stringify comparison reports "the
 * gaps changed" on every single scan, forever.
 *
 * The visible symptom was a flyer redrafted every morning — the scan logged
 * "1 draft(s)" daily for a flyer nobody had touched — and the real cost was
 * that a genuine gap change could never be distinguished from that noise.
 *
 * Compare the identity of the gaps instead: which fields are outstanding and
 * at what severity. Label and question are copy, not state; if they change,
 * the flyer does not need redrawing.
